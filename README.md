A reading list app that I built to improve my understanding of how to use the React Context API along with Hooks.

Check out the app and add your books list at: https://react-context-reading-list-app.netlify.com/

The list is persistent, i.e. it is saved to the browser's local storage. Click on a book to remove it from the list as well as local storage.
